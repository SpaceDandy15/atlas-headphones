# Implementing a Design from Scatch
In this project, we are implementing a web page from scratch, without any library, using all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges we have learned previously.

## Objective
Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer page provided to us.

## Guidelines
Not allowed to use Javascript, or any external CSS frameworks.
